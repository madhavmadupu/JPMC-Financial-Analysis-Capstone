Subject: Potential Asia M&A Targets for Worldwide Brewing Co.

Hi Anna,

Following up on our call with the Hong Kong team, here are the five potential M&A targets in Asia for Worldwide Brewing Co., along with a brief assessment of their strategic fit:

HappyHour Co. (Singapore/Malaysia/China): A market leader in Singapore and Malaysia with strong integrated operations and a $300mm EBITDA. The controlling shareholder (60%) is seeking a strategic buyer to facilitate his retirement, making this a highly feasible opportunity for a direct acquisition.
Spirit Bay (Indonesia/Singapore/Malaysia/China): The #1 player in Indonesia and #2 in Singapore/Malaysia, boasting a large $400mm EBITDA with impressive 40% growth. However, its 60% ownership by a Global Sponsor may complicate a straightforward acquisition, as it could involve a private equity sale process rather than a direct strategic one.
Hipsters’ Ale (Malaysia/Singapore/Indonesia/Japan/Korea/Cambodia): An interesting model with a consortium of 30 independent microbreweries driving its manufacturing. While its $200mm EBITDA and regional presence are attractive, the complex shareholder structure could make integration and management challenging for a new owner.
Brew Co. (Malaysia): As the #1 alcohol manufacturer in Malaysia with a massive $800mm EBITDA, it offers significant scale. However, being a publicly listed company with mostly institutional shareholders and experiencing a 5% EBITDA decline, it may not be an ideal strategic fit or easy to acquire without a complex public offer.
Bevy’s Direct (Singapore & Pan-Asia): A pure-play wholesale distributor with a broad footprint across 9 countries and a $250mm EBITDA. Its simple, family-owned structure makes it a feasible target, but its lack of manufacturing means it doesn't offer the vertical integration that might be ideal for Worldwide Brewing's expansion strategy.
Let me know if you need any further details before sharing these with Carlos.
