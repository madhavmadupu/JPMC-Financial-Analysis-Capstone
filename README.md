## 🍻 HappyHour Co. – Asia M&A Strategic Assessment

A comprehensive investment memorandum and auction process simulation for **HappyHour Co.**, a $3B+ Asia-based beverage leader, as part of a mock M&A due diligence exercise for **Worldwide Brewing Co.** This project synthesizes financial analysis, strategic M&A screening, valuation modeling, and deal process design—all aligned with real-world private equity and corporate development practices.

## 🎯 Project Overview

HappyHour Co. is a market-dominant producer of beer, spirits, and non-alcoholic beverages across Singapore, Malaysia, and China, reporting **$300M EBITDA** (20% YoY growth). With the controlling shareholder (60%) seeking a strategic exit, this project evaluates the opportunity through:

- **Target shortlisting** from a universe of 5 Asia-based beverage companies  
- **Comparative strategic & financial analysis** (growth, ownership, integration risk)  
- **Enterprise valuation** using industry-standard EV/EBITDA multiples (10.0–11.5x)  
- **End-to-end simulation** of a two-stage M&A auction process  
- **Investment memo creation** for executive decision-makers  

Deliverables include a 2-slide analyst deck, executive email brief, and process roadmap—mirroring deliverables from top-tier investment banks and internal M&A teams.

## 🔍 Key Analyses & Deliverables

✅ **M&A Target Screening Matrix**  
- Evaluated 5 companies across dimensions: market position, EBITDA trend, ownership complexity, vertical integration, and strategic fit  
- Identified HappyHour Co. as the optimal target due to clean ownership, growth trajectory, and founder’s preference for a strategic buyer  

✅ **Valuation & Financial Modeling**  
- Calculated **indicative enterprise value**: **$3.0B – $3.45B**  
- Benchmarked against press-reported $3.5B rumor and sector multiples  
- Analyzed segment-level EBITDA contribution (Beer: $135M, Spirits: $105M, NAB: $60M)  

✅ **Auction Process Design**  
- Mapped **two-phase bidding process** (Indicative → Final Bid)  
- Defined critical workstreams:  
  - Bid letter requirements (price, assumptions, funding proof, diligence scope)  
  - Data room access, management Q&A, site visits  
  - Legal & integration readiness expectations  

✅ **Stakeholder & Risk Assessment**  
- Analyzed shareholder dynamics: 60% family control + 40% minority families  
- Flagged post-acquisition retention of founder as a strategic condition  
- Assessed integration risks (Cambodia expansion, outsourced Malaysia production)

## 💡 Why This Project Stands Out

- **Realistic complexity**: Mirrors actual M&A processes led by global advisors  
- **Strategic depth**: Balances financial rigor with qualitative stakeholder insights  
- **ATS-optimized**: Demonstrates keywords like *valuation*, *due diligence*, *EBITDA*, *M&A*, *strategic buyer*, *enterprise value*, *integration*  
- **Executive-ready**: Outputs designed for C-suite and investment committee consumption
